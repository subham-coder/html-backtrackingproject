        <h1>Backtracking</h1>
        <p>Backtracking is a form of recursion.</p>
        <p>This usual scensrio is that you are faced with a number of options, and you must choose one of these. After you make your<br>
        choice you will get a new set of options, just what set of option you get depends on what choice you made. This procedure is<br>
        repeated over and over until you reach a final state. If you made a good sequence of choices, your final statee is a goal state; if<br>
        you didn't, it isn't.
        </p>
        <p>Conceptually, you start at the root of a tree; the tree probably has some good leaves and some bad leaves, though it may be that<br>
        the leaves are all good or all bad. You want to get to a good leaf. At each node. beginning with the root, you choose one of its<br>
        children to move ro, and you keep this up untill you get to a leaf.
        </p>
        <p> Suppose you get to a bad leaf. You can backtrack to continue the search for a good leaf by revoking your most recent choice,<br>
            and trying out the next option in that set of options. If you run out of options, revoke the choice that got you here, and try<br>
